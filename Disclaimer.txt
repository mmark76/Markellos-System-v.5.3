⚠️ No technique, tool, or software functions as a “magic wand.” Nothing can instantly transform someone into a strong memorizer or a good chess player. Progress requires consistency, discipline, practice, patience, and persistence.

⚠️ Mnemonic techniques are highly effective for long-term storage and rapid recall of openings, endgames, and full games. They assist with pure information retrieval, but they cannot replace the deep understanding a chess player needs: strategic thinking, visualization, calculation, evaluation of positions, and tactical skills. To truly “see” the battle on the chessboard, a player needs both: solid understanding together with precise mnemonic recall.

⚠️ The Default Libraries are entirely personal and based on my own Memory Palace. They can be used by anyone, but they will not necessarily work effectively for other users. The optimal approach is for each user to create their own personalized libraries using the tools provided in the application.

⚠️ To import or load a library, the file must follow exactly the structure of the official Library Templates. You may download the official templates using the Download Libraries Templates (zip) button or create correctly structured files through the Create Library feature.
